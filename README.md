# iBeacon Playground
This is a little iOS project to showcase iBeacon system.

In order to build and run this project, you must install project dependencies via CocoaPods. To do so (from the project's root folder):

    $ pod install

Once CocoaPods has finished the installation, open the generated `Beacons Playground.xcworkspace` using Xcode and run the project.
